 Data Analysis Projects

5 Projects were made to achieve a certification in Data Analysis.

Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator:
A function that uses Numpy to output the mean, variance, and standard deviation of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix.

Demographic Data Analyzer:
A dataset of demographic data from the 1994 Census database was Analyzed using Pandas.

Medical Data Visualizer:
visualized and made calculations from medical examination data using matplotlib, seaborn, and pandas.

Page View Time Series Visualizer:
Visualized time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plot. Used Pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03. The data visualizations will helped me understand the patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth.

Sea Level Predictor:
Analyze a dataset of the global average sea level change since 1880. Used the data to predict the sea level change through year 2050.
